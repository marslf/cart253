## Description
In this game, you play as a frog catching flies by launching its tongue. Progressing through three phases, each with different fly types and movement patterns, the goal is to reach 35 points. However, missing three flies results in a game over. Careful timing and aiming are essential to keep up as the challenge increases with each phase.
